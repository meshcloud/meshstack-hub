# IONOS User Management

Welcome to the IONOS User Management system! This guide explains how users are created and managed for your IONOS Cloud environment.

## What This Module Does

‚úÖ **Creates IONOS Users**: Automatically creates user accounts in IONOS Cloud
‚úÖ **Manages Existing Users**: Detects and works with users that already exist
‚úÖ **Role Organization**: Organizes users by their assigned roles (reader, user, admin)
‚úÖ **Lifecycle Protection**: Protects user accounts from accidental deletion

## How It Works

### 1. User Creation Process
- **Check Existing**: First checks if users already exist in IONOS
- **Create New**: Only creates users that don't already exist
- **Assign Roles**: Organizes users based on their role assignments
- **Protect Users**: Sets lifecycle protection to prevent accidental deletion

### 2. Role Categories

**Readers üëÄ**
- Users assigned the "reader" role
- Typically for monitoring and reporting access

**Users üîß**
- Users assigned the "user" role
- Standard operational permissions

**Administrators üõ°Ô∏è**
- Users assigned the "admin" role
- Full administrative access to IONOS Cloud

## Important Information

- **Initial Password**: All users get the same initial password (provided by admin)
- **First Login**: Users must change their password on first login
- **Two-Factor Auth**: Can be enforced for enhanced security
- **Persistent Users**: User accounts persist even if environments are destroyed

## User Management Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment
1. User Management module creates all required users
2. Users receive initial passwords from administrators
3. Users log in and change passwords

### Phase 2: Ongoing Operations
- DCD environments reference existing users
- Users get assigned to appropriate groups and permissions
- User accounts remain stable across environment changes

### Phase 3: Environment Changes
- DCD environments can be created/destroyed safely
- User accounts and permissions persist
- No need to recreate user accounts

## Need Help?

- **Password Reset**: Contact your IONOS administrator
- **Role Changes**: Request role changes through your organization's process
- **Account Issues**: Contact IONOS support or your system administrator

## Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Change default passwords** immediately on first login
‚úÖ **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
‚úÖ **Follow your organization's** security guidelines
‚úÖ **Report suspicious activity** to your security team

**Note**: This user management system is designed for organizational use. Individual users should not attempt to modify their own account settings outside of password changes.
