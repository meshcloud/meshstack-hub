# GitHub Actions Integration with AKS

## Description
This building block provides an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It enables application teams to build, test, and deploy containerized applications seamlessly while following best practices for security and scalability.

## Usage Motivation
This building block is for application teams that want to automate deployments to AKS using GitHub Actions. It simplifies the development lifecycle by integrating automated testing, security scanning, and zero-downtime deployments.

## Usage Examples
- A development team pushes new code to GitHub, triggering an automated pipeline that builds a Docker image, pushes it to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploys it to AKS.
- A DevOps team sets up GitHub Actions workflows to run security scans and compliance checks before deploying applications to AKS.

## Shared Responsibility

| Responsibility          | Platform Team | Application Team |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Setting up GitHub Actions workflows and templates | ✅ | ❌ |
| Managing AKS cluster configuration and networking | ✅ | ❌ |
| Ensuring secure authentication between GitHub and Azure | ✅ | ❌ |
| Writing and maintaining application-specific deployment configurations | ❌ | ✅ |
| Managing Kubernetes manifests (Helm charts, Kustomize, etc.) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Monitoring deployments and troubleshooting issues | ❌ | ✅ |

## Recommendations for Secure and Efficient CI/CD Pipeline
- **Use OIDC authentication**: Avoid storing Azure credentials by enabling OpenID Connect (OIDC) for GitHub Actions authentication.
- **Implement branch protection rules**: Require pull request approvals and CI checks before merging code.
- **Enable secret scanning**: Prevent exposure of sensitive information using GitHub’s built-in secret scanning.
- **Use deployment strategies**: Implement rolling updates or blue-green deployments for minimal downtime.
- **Monitor and log deployments**: Integrate Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for visibility into CI/CD performance.
