# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Description
This building block provides a production-grade Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with integrated security, monitoring, and networking features. It delivers a fully managed Kubernetes environment with Azure AD authentication, workload identity support, and comprehensive observability through Log Analytics. The cluster supports both public and private deployment scenarios with optional hub-and-spoke network connectivity.

## Usage Motivation
This building block is for application teams that need to deploy containerized applications on a secure, scalable, and managed Kubernetes platform. The AKS cluster comes pre-configured with enterprise-grade security features, eliminating the operational complexity of managing Kubernetes infrastructure while maintaining the flexibility to run any containerized workload.

## üöÄ Usage Examples
- A development team deploys microservices-based applications using Kubernetes deployments, services, and ingress controllers.
- A data engineering team runs distributed data processing workloads using Kubernetes jobs and cron jobs.
- An operations team manages multi-tenant applications with namespace isolation and resource quotas.
- A DevOps team implements GitOps-based continuous deployment pipelines targeting the AKS cluster.

## üí° Best Practices for Secure and Efficient AKS Usage

### Security
- **Use Workload Identity**: Leverage Azure AD Workload Identity for secure authentication to Azure resources without storing credentials
- **Implement Network Policies**: Define Kubernetes Network Policies to control pod-to-pod communication
- **Enable Pod Security Standards**: Apply Kubernetes Pod Security Standards to enforce security best practices
- **Use Azure Key Vault**: Store secrets in Azure Key Vault and inject them into pods using CSI Secret Store driver
- **Scan container images**: Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment

### Performance & Scalability
- **Set resource requests and limits**: Always define CPU and memory requests/limits for predictable scheduling and resource management
- **Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Implement HPA to automatically scale applications based on metrics
- **Optimize container images**: Use multi-stage builds and minimal base images to reduce image size and startup time
- **Implement health probes**: Configure liveness and readiness probes for reliable application health monitoring

### Operations & Monitoring
- **Use structured logging**: Implement structured logging (JSON) for better log analysis in Log Analytics
- **Monitor cluster metrics**: Regularly review cluster metrics in Azure Monitor for capacity planning
- **Implement GitOps**: Use GitOps tools like Flux or ArgoCD for declarative application deployment
- **Tag resources**: Use labels and annotations consistently for resource organization and cost allocation

### Networking
- **Use Ingress controllers**: Deploy an Ingress controller for HTTP/HTTPS routing instead of multiple LoadBalancer services
- **Implement egress control**: Use Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups to control outbound traffic
- **Enable service mesh**: Consider using a service mesh (like Istio or Linkerd) for advanced traffic management and observability

## Cluster Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Azure AD Integration**: Cluster uses Azure AD for authentication, enabling centralized identity management (optional)
- **OIDC Issuer**: Workload Identity enabled for secure pod-to-Azure-resource authentication

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralized logging for cluster and application logs (optional)
- **Container Insights**: Integrated monitoring for container performance and health
- **Diagnostic Settings**: Cluster metrics and logs forwarded to Log Analytics

### Networking
- **Custom VNet**: Dedicated virtual network and subnet for cluster isolation
- **Azure CNI**: Advanced networking capabilities with pod-level networking
- **Private Cluster**: Optional private API server accessible only via private endpoint
- **Hub Connectivity**: Optional VNet peering to central hub network for on-premises connectivity

### Auto-Scaling
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts node count based on resource requirements (when enabled)
- **System Node Pool**: Dedicated node pool for system workloads with optional auto-scaling

## Deployment Scenarios

### Public Cluster (Default)
```hcl
module "aks" {
  source = "./buildingblock"

  aks_cluster_name             = "my-public-aks"
  resource_group_name          = "aks-rg"
  location                     = "West Europe"
  aks_admin_group_object_id    = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  log_analytics_workspace_name = "my-law"
}
```

### Private Cluster with Hub Connectivity
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  alias           = "hub"
  subscription_id = "hub-subscription-id"
  # hub credentials
}

module "aks" {
  source = "./buildingblock"

  providers = {
    azurerm     = azurerm
    azurerm.hub = azurerm.hub
  }

  aks_cluster_name             = "my-private-aks"
  resource_group_name          = "aks-rg"
  location                     = "West Europe"

  # Private cluster settings
  private_cluster_enabled           = true
  private_dns_zone_id               = "System"
  private_cluster_public_fqdn_enabled = false

  # Hub connectivity
  hub_subscription_id      = "hub-subscription-id"
  hub_resource_group_name  = "hub-network-rg"
  hub_vnet_name            = "hub-vnet"

  # Azure AD and monitoring
  aks_admin_group_object_id    = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  log_analytics_workspace_name = "my-law"
}
```

### Private Cluster without Hub (Isolated)
```hcl
module "aks" {
  source = "./buildingblock"

  aks_cluster_name                  = "my-isolated-aks"
  resource_group_name               = "aks-rg"
  location                          = "West Europe"
  private_cluster_enabled           = true
  private_dns_zone_id               = "System"
  aks_admin_group_object_id         = "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012"
  log_analytics_workspace_name      = "my-law"
}
```

## Getting Started

### Public Cluster
1. **Access the cluster**: Use `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <rg> --name <cluster-name>` to configure kubectl access
2. **Verify connectivity**: Run `kubectl get nodes` to confirm cluster connectivity
3. **Deploy your application**: Use `kubectl apply` or Helm to deploy applications
4. **Monitor your workloads**: View logs and metrics in Azure Monitor or Log Analytics

### Private Cluster
