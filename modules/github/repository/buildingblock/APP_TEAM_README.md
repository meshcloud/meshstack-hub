# GitHub Repository

## Description
This building block provides an automated way to create and manage GitHub repositories for application teams. It supports creating new repositories with predefined configurations, including access control, branch protection rules, and compliance settings. For existing repositories, it provides a read-only data source that fetches repository information for ownership tracking in meshStack and enables other building blocks to reference the repository.

## Usage Motivation
This building block is for application teams that need a structured and standardized approach to managing source code in GitHub. For new repositories, it ensures security, compliance, and best practices are followed from the start. For existing repositories, it provides a way to track ownership in meshStack and enables integration with other building blocks that need to reference the repository.

## Usage Examples
- A development team provisions a new GitHub repository with predefined branch protection rules and required code owners.
- A DevOps team sets up a repository with automation for CI/CD pipelines, ensuring all commits trigger predefined workflows.
- An application team references an existing repository for ownership tracking in meshStack without modifying its configuration.
- Other building blocks depend on this building block to get repository information and integrate with existing GitHub repositories.

## Shared Responsibility

| Responsibility          | Platform Team | Application Team |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Automating repository creation and configuration | ✅ | ❌ |
| Fetching existing repository information for tracking | ✅ | ❌ |
| Enforcing security policies (e.g., branch protection, required reviews) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Creating new repositories | ✅ | ❌ |
| Managing repository content (code, issues, pull requests) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Configuring CI/CD workflows | ❌ | ✅ |
| Managing repository access (teams, roles, permissions) | ❌ | ✅ |

## Recommendations for Secure and Efficient GitHub Usage

- **Use branch protection rules**: Require code reviews before merging to main branches.
- **Enable GitHub Actions security settings**: Restrict access to secrets and enforce workflow permissions.
- **Define a clear repository structure**: Include `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODEOWNERS` files.
- **Monitor repository activity**: Use GitHub Insights and security alerts for proactive monitoring.
