# GitHub Repository

## Description
This building block provides an automated way to create and manage GitHub repositories for application teams. It ensures repositories are set up with predefined configurations, including access control, branch protection rules, and compliance settings.

## Usage Motivation
This building block is for application teams that need a structured and standardized approach to managing source code in GitHub. It ensures security, compliance, and best practices are followed from the start.

## Usage Examples
- A development team provisions a new GitHub repository with predefined branch protection rules and required code owners.
- A DevOps team sets up a repository with automation for CI/CD pipelines, ensuring all commits trigger predefined workflows.

## Shared Responsibility

| Responsibility          | Platform Team | Application Team |
|------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Automating repository creation and configuration | ✅ | ❌ |
| Enforcing security policies (e.g., branch protection, required reviews) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Creating the repository | ✅ | ❌ |
| Managing repository content (code, issues, pull requests) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Configuring CI/CD workflows | ❌ | ✅ |
| Managing repository access (teams, roles, permissions) | ❌ | ✅ |

## Recommendations for Secure and Efficient GitHub Usage
- **Use branch protection rules**: Require code reviews before merging to main branches.
- **Enable GitHub Actions security settings**: Restrict access to secrets and enforce workflow permissions.
- **Define a clear repository structure**: Include `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODEOWNERS` files.
- **Monitor repository activity**: Use GitHub Insights and security alerts for proactive monitoring.
