# iaas.network.admin at org scope allows creating networks in any tenant project

# the backplane is deployed once, before the target project of any future
# instance is known, so permissions can't be scoped to a single project ahead of
# time. Least-privilege alternative: if STACKIT introduces a narrower
# "network.editor" role, prefer that.
