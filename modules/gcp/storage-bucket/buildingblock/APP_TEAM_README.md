# GCP Storage Bucket

## Description
Provides a Google Cloud Storage bucket for scalable object storage with built-in security and performance optimization.

## Usage Motivation
Perfect for teams building cloud-native applications that need reliable data storage. Ideal for:
- Application artifacts and user-generated content
- Data lakes and machine learning pipelines
- Multi-region content distribution

## Usage Examples
- **ML Team**: Stores training datasets and model artifacts for AutoML workflows
- **DevOps Team**: Archives container images and deployment artifacts with global replication

## Shared Responsibility

| Responsibility | Platform Team | Application Team |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Bucket provisioning & security baseline | ✅ | ❌ |
| Data lifecycle & access management | ❌ | ✅ |
| Content upload & application integration | ❌ | ✅ |

## Best Practices
- Leverage **multi-regional** storage for high availability
- Use **IAM conditions** for fine-grained access control
- Implement **Object Lifecycle Management** for cost optimization
- Enable **uniform bucket-level access** for simplified permissions
