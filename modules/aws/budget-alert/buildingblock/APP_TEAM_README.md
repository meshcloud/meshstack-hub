This building block sets up an AWS budget alert on your account and is intended for teams managing AWS workloads who want to avoid accidental overspending by proactively monitoring cloud costs.

## 🚀 Usage Examples
- A development team sets up an AWS budget alert to **receive notifications** when their monthly AWS spend exceeds 80% of their allocated budget.
- A FinOps engineer configures alerts for multiple AWS accounts to **track overall cloud costs** across different projects and take early action if spending spikes.

## 🔄 Shared Responsibility

| Responsibility        | Platform Team ✅ | Application Team ✅/❌ |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Provides automation for AWS Budget setup | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manages alert delivery mechanism (e.g., SNS, email) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Defines the budget threshold | ❌ | ✅ |
| Adjusts alerts based on cost trends | ❌ | ✅ |

## 💡 Best Practices for Choosing a Budget Threshold
To set an effective budget alert:
- Start with **historical AWS spend** as a baseline.
- Set alerts at **80% and 95% of the budget** to allow for proactive adjustments.
- Consider **seasonal or usage-based variations** in cloud costs.
- Use **multiple alerts** (e.g., per service, per team) if necessary to get granular insights.
