# AWS Opt-In Region Building Block

The AWS Opt-In Region building block enables you to enable AWS regions that require explicit opt-in for your AWS account. This is particularly useful for managing access to newer AWS regions or regions with specific compliance requirements.

## When to use this

Use this building block when you need to:

- **Enable new regions**: Grant access to newer AWS regions that require explicit opt-in
- **Compliance requirements**: Enable specific regions to meet data residency or compliance needs

## Common opt-in regions

Some regions that typically require opt-in include:
- Asia Pacific regions (ap-southeast-3, ap-south-2, etc.)
- Middle East regions (me-south-1, me-central-1)
- Africa regions (af-south-1)
- Europe regions (eu-south-1, eu-south-2)
