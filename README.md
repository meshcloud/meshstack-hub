# meshStack Hub

The meshStack Hub provides a collection of ready-to-use Terraform modules that can directly be
used in your meshStack as Building Blocks.

See what's out there on [hub.meshcloud.io](https://hub.meshcloud.io)!

## üì¶ Available Modules

We recommend looking at all available modules on [hub.meshcloud.io](https://hub.meshcloud.io).
Alternatively, you can find all available modules in the `modules/` directory separated by platform.

Example modules:

AWS S3 Module ‚Äì Provision S3 buckets with encryption and logging.

## üè¢Ô∏è Structure

All Terraform modules are listed in the `modules/` directory.
This directory is split into subdirectories for each platform.
In a platform's directory, you will find all modules that are available for that platform.

A single module is structured as follows:

```
module_name/
    building_block/ -- This is the *actual* Terraform module that provisions resources.
        main.tf
        provider.tf
        outputs.tf
        variables.tf
    backplane/ -- This is the Terraform code that provisions all supporting resources such as roles & techical users.
        <... Terraform files ...>
    README.md -- This describes the module and how to use it.
```

## üîß Usage

Any module that you find works within meshStack.
The easiest option is to directly import the module from the [meshStack Hub](https://hub.meshcloud.io) into your own meshStack by clicking the "Import" button on the module page.

Refer to each module's README.md for specific usage instructions such as needed input variables.
